!["Netflix Project"](https://images.ctfassets.net/y2ske730sjqp/1aONibCke6niZhgPxuiilC/2c401b05a07288746ddf3bd3943fbc76/BrandAssets_Logos_01-Wordmark.jpg?w=940)
State the purpose, methods, results, and conclusions

The purpose of this project is to learn RStudio/R. If you look at the same bits of data I did, you can deduce the most watched profile, device, and series!

## Context
Netflix is a multi-billion dollar streaming company. The service primarily distributes original and acquired films and television shows from various genres, and it is available internationally in multiple languages (Wikipedia). <br><br>
For advertising, for the viewers (so they know what they have seen), and reccomendations, netflix has to keep track of all of the user's data. Which makes it a perfect data set to analyze (there aren't any null values)

## How to do this yourself
1. First, request your data from Netflix. They should send it within a few business days in the form of a zip file.
2. Unzip the folder and find the "ViewingActivity.csv" (you'll use that as your dataframe)
3. Install RStudio and Python (respective tutorials linked)
4. Import necessary libraries
5. Make graphs and analyze your data

## Notes for the future
Label your x-axis with the unit of measurement in time! It really helps with your analysis. 

## The Presentation
I made my presentation in PowerPoint, but you ca make it in anything! It's up to you how you present your data, but I would reccomend PowerPoint or Google Slides.

** *I didn't upload the csv file I used because that's all of my Netflix data, which doesn't need to be out there online. :)**
